Uno Minimalist Base

Compatible with the Uno series.

This base prints in under an hour. We used PLA, but other material should work fine.

Base can be mounted as it has two M3 holes.

There are four M2.5 mounting standoffs. It is not required to install brass nuts into these to use the Base, but it is nice.
Use M2.5 brass insert nuts and matching screws. 

To install the brass inserts:
- Place nut over tip of soldering iron (pointy tip). Let heat up for just a few seconds.
- Make sure the up side, is down on the iron, or the nut will be installed upside down.
- Gently press the nut into the 3D printed standoff. Don't push all the way, stop when the nut is about 1mm out.
- Use a small piece of PCB or something else flat and firm to press the nut in the rest of the way.
- Reheat with iron if it cooled too much. Go slow and low heat.
- Start with the two standoffs on side of the ICSP header. These have a larger base and are less likly to melt.
- The other two standoffs closer to the USB-C port have a thinner base. Be careful these melt easily.
